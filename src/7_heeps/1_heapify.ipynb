    "In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure. Each element in a priority queue has an associated priority. In a priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a priority queue is an abstract data structure. A heap is one of many ways to implement a priority queue. \n",
    "```\n",

    "**A heap is a container that stores elements, and supports the following operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add an element in O(log n)\n",
    "- Remove the minimum element in  O(logn)\n",
    "- Find the minimum element in O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity, we'll talk about min heaps in this article, although the logic is the same for max heaps."

    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a general algorithm used for traversing or searching through tree or graph data structures. The fundamental principle of BFS is to explore all nodes at the present \"depth\" (or level) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. While BFS itself is a single algorithm, there are different variations and applications of BFS depending on the problem context:"

    "Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant work. It is particularly effective for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. DP involves defining subproblems, establishing a recurrence relation, and using either memoization (storing results in a lookup table) or tabulation (building a table iteratively) to solve them efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Essentially, DP improves upon brute force by storing the results of subproblems (caching) to avoid redundant calculations, making it much more efficient.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Subsets vs. Subsequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Order of Elements:**\n",
    "   - **Subsets:** Order does not matter. Elements can appear in any order.\n",
    "   - **Subsequences:** Order matters. Elements must appear in the same order as they do in the original sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Definition:**\n",
    "   - **Subsets:** A subset is any combination of elements from a set, including the empty set and the set itself. **[1,2] and [2,1]** are considered the **same subset.**\n",
    "   - **Subsequences:** A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Total Number:**\n",
    "   - **Subsets:** For a set with \\( n \\) elements, there are \\( 2^n \\) subsets.\n",
    "   - **Subsequences:** For a sequence with \\( n \\) elements, there are \\( 2^n \\) subsequences.\n",

    "   - **Subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}:**\n",
    "     - Empty subset: {}\n",
    "     - Subsets with 1 element: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}\n",
    "     - Subsets with 2 elements: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}\n",
    "     - Subsets with 3 elements: {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}\n",
    "     - Subset with all 4 elements: {1,2,3,4}\n",
    "     - Note: {1,2} and {2,1} are considered the same subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Subsequences of {1, 2, 3, 4}:**\n",
    "     - Empty subsequence: {}\n",
    "     - Subsequences with 1 element: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}\n",
    "     - Subsequences with 2 elements: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}\n",
    "     - Subsequences with 3 elements: {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}\n",
    "     - Subsequence with all 4 elements: {1,2,3,4}\n",
    "     - Note: {1,3} is a subsequence, but {3,1} is not (order matters).\n",

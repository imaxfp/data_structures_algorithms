    "Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it up into smaller subproblems, and store the results of the subproblems for later use (to reduce duplication).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Each subproblem is **solved only once and stored for future reference, ensuring that each subproblem's solution is used optimally.** This approach avoids redundant calculations and improves efficiency.\n",

    "### Dynamic programming (DP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant work. It is particularly effective for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. DP involves defining subproblems, establishing a recurrence relation, and using either memoization (storing results in a lookup table) or tabulation (building a table iteratively) to solve them efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Essentially, DP improves upon brute force by storing the results of subproblems (caching) to avoid redundant calculations, making it much more efficient.**\n",
